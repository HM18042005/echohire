        "AI: That's a comprehensive approach! Let me ask about system design. How would you architect a real-time collaborative editing feature, similar to Google Docs?",
        "Candidate: I'd use WebSockets for real-time communication, implement operational transformation for conflict resolution, use a central authority server for state management, and include optimistic updates with rollback mechanisms for better UX.",
